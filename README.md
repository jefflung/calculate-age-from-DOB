Calculate Age from Year of Birth
1.	Create a new file and name it Age_From_YoB 
2.	Accept a user’s year of birth from the keyboard 
3.	Calculate the user’s age and print it on the screen 

Summary:
Initially, I used the current year 2021 to deduct the year of birth typed by the user.
However, I want to improve the program being flexible for any year, so I created a
variable “now” which uses the built-in function datetime and now to get the recent
year. Therefore, age is calculated from deduction between current year and year of
birth input by the user.

Self-reflection:
In this exercise, I have learnt that a built-in function to get the current date is more
flexible than a fixed year value.
